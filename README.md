# Blog API

A simple Go API built with Gin that serves blog posts from markdown files. Stupidly simple, just the way it should be!

## Features

- üìù Write blog posts in Markdown
- üè∑Ô∏è YAML frontmatter for metadata (title, date, tags, excerpt)
- üöÄ Fast and lightweight Go API using Gin
- üì± JSON API responses perfect for frontends
- üîÑ CORS enabled for web applications
- üìÇ File-based storage (no database needed)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd blog-api
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Run the API:**

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. **API will be available at:** `http://localhost:8080`

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                              |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`            | API information and available endpoints  |
| GET    | `/posts`       | List all blog posts (metadata only)      |
| GET    | `/posts/:slug` | Get specific blog post with full content |

## Writing Blog Posts

Create markdown files in the `posts/` directory. Each file should have:

1. **Filename**: Use kebab-case, this becomes the URL slug (e.g., `my-first-post.md` ‚Üí `/posts/my-first-post`)

2. **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata at the top:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: "2025-06-05"
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
   excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
   ---
   ```

3. **Content**: Regular markdown below the frontmatter

### Example Post

````markdown
---
title: "My Awesome Post"
date: "2025-06-05"
tags: ["golang", "api", "blogging"]
excerpt: "This is what my post is about"
---

# My Awesome Post

This is the content of my post written in **markdown**.

## Subheading

- List item 1
- List item 2

`code blocks work too`
````

- If no date is provided, the file modification time is used
- CORS is enabled for all origins (configure as needed for production)

## Deployment

This is a standard Go application. You can:
