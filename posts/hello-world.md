# Hello World

There isn't anything meaningful in this post - apart from maybe a wince when looking back in time at this.

The main reason I want to start up a blog isn't for _anyone_ to read it, but rather for me to reference a thought I had one time and share that with those around me.

I'll likely ramble about tech stuff, side projects, and probably weave my 2 dogs into the mix.

Test post, please ignore
